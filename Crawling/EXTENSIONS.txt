To extend beyond Amazon.com:

We would need to change selectors to grab and parse correct elements from web page that lead us to product pages.



To grab products beyond books:
Depending on the product category/type, we my need to change how we parse each product category page. 
 
Will need to implement a different system to keep track of unique products instead of ISBN-13 which is specific to books.
Since the URLs are dynamically generated, URLs for same product can change depending on how you get to product. 

Create class constructor for generic product so we can handle all products.
